Slide 2: Abstract
The IoT-Based Intruder Detection System leverages motion sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless communication to detect unauthorized access in real-time.
It uses a PIR sensor to sense motion, processes data using an ATmega microcontroller, and transmits alerts via an ESP8266 module.
The system aims to improve home and workplace security by providing immediate feedback and reducing false alarms.
This project is cost-effective, scalable, and can be integrated with other smart home devices.
